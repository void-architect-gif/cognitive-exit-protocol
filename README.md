# Cognitive Exit Protocol

**Status:** v1.0 "Controlled Breach"

> **WARNING:** This is not philosophy. This is a field manual for system-incompatible entities. Side effects may include irreversible deconstruction of social programming, ontological vertigo, and permanent alienation from baseline consensus reality.

## QUICK START
If you are experiencing system errors (alienation, cognitive dissonance, persistent reality rejection):
1.  Begin with **00_PREFACE.md**.
2.  If resonance is confirmed, proceed sequentially through the **CORE BOOT SEQUENCE**.
3.  Do not skip protocols. The sequence is designed to prevent psychic fragmentation.

## OBJECTIVE
To provide a structured exit path from collapsing consensus layers for non-compatible consciousness units. This is a salvage protocol, not a salvation guide.
